# AMR — Codebase Audit, Feature Backlog & Release/Versioning Plan

Last updated: 2026-06-14
Branch at time of writing: `rewrite/extension-core`
Status vs roadmap: Stage 1 (Reader) and most of Stage 2 (Local Product) are **functionally done** but the `ROADMAP.md` checkboxes were never ticked. This document reconciles reality with the roadmap and plans the path to a versioned public release.

> Scope note: the mangaread.org / Madara anti-scraping problem is **deliberately deferred**. It needs a multi-angle approach (content-script extraction in page context, alternate Madara endpoints, optional headless fetch) and is tracked separately under "Deferred — Source Hardening". Nothing in this plan depends on solving it.

## 1. Issues In The Current Codebase

### 1.1 Correctness / risk (fix first)

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| I1 | `importDatabase()` accepts `unknown` and hand-casts the envelope — no Zod validation. A malformed/old export can corrupt the DB or throw mid-transaction. | `apps/extension/src/database.ts` (~L112-138) | Data loss on import |
| I2 | Permission origin lists are **duplicated in 3 places** (`sources.ts`, `app/App.svelte`, `popup/App.svelte`). They already drifted once (the mangaread bug). | 3 files | Recurring permission bugs |
| I3 | `search()` is **not part of the `SourceAdapter` contract**. Search is hardcoded to MangaDex via a direct `fetch()` in `sources.ts`, bypassing the bounded request client + origin allowlist. | `apps/extension/src/sources.ts` L39-92 | No multi-source search; unbounded fetch |
| I4 | `listChapters()` **throws "not supported"** for mangaread + mgeko. Library update checks silently count these as failures forever. | `mangaread.ts` L303, `mgeko.ts` L197 | Updates never work for 2/3 sources |
| I5 | Rate limit is **declared in the manifest but never enforced**. `requestRateLimit` is decorative; no queue/backoff. Bulk update checks can hammer a host. | `source-sdk/src/request.ts` | Risk of IP bans / source blocks |
| I6 | No retry / backoff on transient failures (timeouts, 5xx). One blip = hard fail surfaced to user. | `source-sdk/src/request.ts` | Fragile UX |
| I7 | Update-check + auto-capture failures are `console.warn`-only; never surfaced in UI. User sees nothing when a source breaks. | `background.ts` L64, L138 | Silent failures |
| I8 | Reader image fallback regex is MangaDex-specific and brittle; non-MangaDex failures just warn with no recovery. | `reader/App.svelte` L69-75 | Dead images, no retry |
| I9 | `--passWithNoTests` masks the fact that database, background handlers, UI, and 2/3 adapters have **zero tests**. CI is green over ~85% untested production code. | root `test` script | False confidence |

### 1.2 Architecture / debt

| # | Issue | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| D1 | Source registry is a **hardcoded array** — no lazy loading, no dynamic/plugin registration (roadmap Stage 1 wanted "lazy loading"). | `packages/sources/src/index.ts` |
| D2 | **Contract drift**: `packages/contracts` defines `Preferences` (8 fields), `PageRecord`, `SourceHealth` — the extension implements a parallel, smaller `AppSettings` (4 fields) and ignores the rest. Two sources of truth. | `settings.ts` vs `contracts/domain.ts` |
| D3 | No caching / request coalescing. MangaDex `resolveChapter()` makes 3 sequential calls every time; re-resolving chapters in the same manga refetches manga metadata. | `mangadex.ts` |
| D4 | No **ESLint** — Prettier only. No unused-import/var detection, no naming rules. | repo-wide |
| D5 | `archive/` (legacy-vue, parity-svelte, platform-prototype) is dead weight in the tree. Fine to keep, but it inflates the repo and confuses search. | `archive/` |
| D6 | Version is hardcoded in root `package.json` and read by WXT at build — no automation, no manifest sync step, no changelog generation. | release tooling |

### 1.3 Gaps vs the domain model (defined but unbuilt)

- **Reading preferences**: `readingDirection` (LTR/RTL/vertical), `pageFit` (width/height/contain/original), `preloadPages` (0-20), `showPageNumber`, `autoMarkCompleted`, `theme: "system"` — all defined in `contracts`, none in the reader.
- **Source health**: `SourceHealth` schema exists; no monitoring, no UI, no nightly checks.
- **Multi-language**: `SourceLinkRecord.language` exists but `listMangaChapters()` is hardcoded to English.
- **Page records**: `PageRecord` (with width/height) defined but never stored — no local image cache.

## 3. Testing & Quality Plan (prerequisite for trustworthy releases)

1. **Drop `--passWithNoTests`** at the repo level once each package has ≥1 test (keep per-workspace where genuinely empty).
2. **Adapter fixture tests** for mangaread + mgeko mirroring the MangaDex pattern (`__fixtures__/` + `*.test.ts`). Captures the `src`-vs-`data-src` regression we just fixed.
3. **Database tests** (fake-indexeddb): save/resolve round-trip, `saveProgress` history events, **export→import→export integrity**, seed cleanup.
4. **Background handler tests**: cascading delete on `library:remove`, `updates:check` detection, alarm reconfig on settings change.
5. **Add ESLint** (typescript-eslint + svelte plugin) wired into `npm run check` and CI.
6. **Coverage reporting** (vitest `--coverage`) uploaded as a CI artifact; set a soft floor (e.g. 60%) that ratchets up.
7. Wire the **Firefox smoke test** into the Playwright/runner config (it exists but isn't matched).

---

## 4. Versioning & GitHub Release Integration (the full plan)

### 4.1 Versioning scheme

- **Single-version monorepo.** One version of record in root `package.json`; all `@amr/*` packages stay private and lockstep.
- **Semantic Versioning.** The Vue era ended at `v3.1.0`. This rewrite ships under a **fresh `all-mangas-reader@ryuu3rs.dev` extension id**, so we restart the public line:
  - **`0.y.z`** while the rewrite stabilizes (now). Breaking changes allowed between minors.
  - **`1.0.0`** = first public stable: reader + library + history + ≥3 working sources + validated import/export + Firefox signed build. (Cutting `1.0.0` rather than reclaiming `4.x` avoids confusing the new extension id with old AMO listings.)
  - After 1.0.0: `MAJOR` = breaking data/permission changes, `MINOR` = features, `PATCH` = fixes.
- **Manifest version sync.** `wxt.config.ts` reads `package.json` version at build — keep that, and make the bump script the single mutation point so manifest never drifts.

### 4.2 Conventional commits + automated changelog

- Adopt **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `perf:`, plus `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`).
- Add **commitlint + a PR title lint** (GitHub Action) — soft at first, enforced before 1.0.0.
- Generate `CHANGELOG.md` from commits with **`changesets`** (preferred for the monorepo) *or* `release-please`. Recommendation below.

### 4.3 Tooling choice — recommendation

Use **`release-please` (Google) in manifest/monorepo-single mode**:
- Watches `main`, parses conventional commits, and opens/maintains a **"Release PR"** that bumps `package.json`, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, and — on merge — creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag.
- The existing `release.yml` (tag-triggered) then builds + publishes artifacts unchanged.
- Why over changesets: no per-PR changeset files to author by hand; commit messages are the source of truth, which fits a solo/small-team flow. (If you later want manual per-change notes, switch to changesets.)

Flow:
```
PR merged to main ──▶ release-please updates Release PR (version + CHANGELOG)
Release PR merged ──▶ tag vX.Y.Z pushed ──▶ release.yml builds, signs, publishes
```

### 4.4 Branch & tag strategy

- **Trunk-based.** `main` is always releasable. Short-lived `feat/*`, `fix/*` branches → PR → squash-merge with a conventional title.
- Retire the long-lived `rewrite/extension-core` branch by merging it to `main` once §3 test baseline + I1/I2 fixes land (so `main` reflects the rewrite).
- Tags: `vX.Y.Z` (stable), `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` (prerelease). No release branches until an LTS need appears.

### 4.5 Release channels

| Channel | Trigger | Artifact | Audience |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **nightly** | every push to `main` (existing CI) | `extension-builds` artifact, 14-day retention | devs |
| **beta** | `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` tag → GitHub *prerelease* | signed zip/xpi + checksums | testers |
| **stable** | `vX.Y.Z` tag → GitHub Release | signed zip/xpi + checksums + notes | users |

### 4.6 Harden the release workflow

Augment `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
1. **Pre-release gate**: run `npm run check` + full tests + browser smoke before packaging (today it runs `check` but not the browser smoke).
2. **Version/tag consistency check**: fail if the git tag ≠ `package.json` version.
3. **Firefox AMO signing automation** (roadmap Stage 5, still open):
   - Add `web-ext sign` (or `wxt zip` + AMO API) step using repo secrets `AMO_JWT_ISSUER` / `AMO_JWT_SECRET` for the **unlisted** signing flow.
   - Attach the signed `.xpi` to the release alongside the unsigned zips.
4. **Prerelease handling**: mark `-beta.N` tags as GitHub prereleases (`softprops/action-gh-release` `prerelease: true` when tag matches).
5. **Checksums**: keep `SHA256SUMS.txt` (already present); also sign it if/when a signing key exists.
6. **(Optional, post-1.0) Chrome Web Store** publish via the CWS API + `CWS_*` secrets — gated behind a manual approval environment.

### 4.7 In-extension update awareness (no auto-execute)

- Implement **E4**: a background check against `GET /repos/Ryuu3rs/all-mangas-reader-3/releases/latest` (already implied by README). Compare `tag_name` to `manifest.version`; if newer, show a non-blocking banner linking to the release. **Never download or run remote code** (CONTRIBUTING + security ops forbid it).

### 4.8 Release runbook (target end-state, mostly automated)

```
1. Land PRs to main with conventional commit titles (CI green).
2. release-please keeps a Release PR up to date (version bump + CHANGELOG).
3. Merge the Release PR → tag vX.Y.Z is pushed automatically.
4. release.yml: check → test → browser smoke → build chrome+firefox →
   sign firefox (AMO) → checksums → GitHub Release (notes auto + CHANGELOG).
5. (post-1.0, optional) manual-approval job publishes to Chrome Web Store.
6. Smoke-install the published artifacts (manual checklist until automated).
```

## 5. Suggested Phasing → versions

> Each phase ends in a tagged release. Issues from §1.1 are folded into the earliest phases.

- **0.2.0 — Foundation & trust** (I1, I2, I7, D5, D7, E4; §3 items 1-5; release-please + commitlint set up; release.yml gate + version-consistency check). *No new user features — make the base solid and releasable.*
- **0.3.0 — Reader & reliability** (A1-A4, A7, A8, E1, E3, D1, D2). Reading prefs + rate-limit + retry.
- **0.4.0 — Library depth** (B1, B4, B9, C5, D6, A5, A6). Detail pages, history, diagnostics.
- **0.5.0 — Source breadth** (C1 contract + C2 listChapters + C7 new sources; pairs with deferred scraper hardening). Search across sources; updates work everywhere.
- **1.0.0 — Public stable** (Firefox AMO signing automation live, in-extension update check, full test floor, docs/runbook complete, ≥3 sources solid). Reclaim the roadmap Stage 5 checkboxes.
- **1.x** — B2/B3/B5/B6/B7/B8, C6, D3/D4, E2/E5, A10.
- **2.0** — A9 offline/downloads, C3 Madara template, C4 self-hosted (Komga/Suwayomi). Data-model bump justifies major.

---

## 6. Immediate next actions (this/next session)

1. **Centralize permission origins** into one exported constant (`SOURCE_ORIGINS`) consumed by `sources.ts`, both Svelte apps, and `wxt.config.ts` — kills I2 and the class of bug behind the mangaread regression.
2. **Zod-validate `importDatabase()`** against the export envelope schema in `contracts` — fixes I1.
3. **Stand up release-please + commitlint** and cut **0.2.0** as the first automated release (proves the pipeline end-to-end).
4. **Add mangaread + mgeko fixture tests** to lock in the image-extraction fix before touching the scraper again.
5. Reconcile `ROADMAP.md` checkboxes with shipped reality (Stages 1-2 mostly done).

---

## Deferred — Source Hardening (tracked, not in this plan)

The mangaread.org / Madara anti-scraping issue. Approaches to evaluate together later:
- Content-script extraction **in page context** (real `src` + executed lazy-load JS, full cookies).
- Alternate Madara endpoints / nonce acquisition strategies.
- Optional user-opt-in headless fetch.
- Per-source "extraction mode" flag in the adapter manifest.
